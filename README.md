# one-monokai-darker-spectrum 

While installing dozens of themes, I realized that the only way to find the perfect theme is to make it. Or to be more precise, combine 2 other themes into one. 

Gray background with **lots** of colors. Maybe you will like it ðŸ˜‡

Used only with  **C++** and did not test it in other languages.
